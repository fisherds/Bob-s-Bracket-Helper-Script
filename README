Wanted to make a JavaScript that Bob could add to his entry pages to help control user input.

The goal is to do a few tasks:
 - Reduce the list of options in a game to only the teams remaining
 - Auto backfill a team as winner an earlier round if they win a later round
 - Make sure the form can't be submitted until all the games have been marked
 - Learn a few more Closure skills.

Pools will be up at:
